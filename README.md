# plsql-plsql-adv-projects

PLSQL projects used to solve some business issues:

1- first project is used to create sequences and trigger for each table in the schema.
the sequence should start from the maximum number in the primary key column +1.
the sequence would only be created if the the table have one primary key column and it has (int) data type.
trigger is made to add the next value of the primary key column sequence when inserting a new record. so the user don't have to insert the primary key column value.


2- Second project is used to import the new employees records in a temporary table.
checking the integrity of the data.
checking the departments, city and regions occurance in the parent tables, and if not insert them first.
lastely import the data from the temporary table to the main empolyees table.
